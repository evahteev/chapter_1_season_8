# Community driven AI and Analytics for GuruScan

We are extending season 7 product GuruScan with Analytics and AI features based of feedback we've
got last time. We are making it community driven, so anyone can utilize the data we are indexing for 
block explorer to create new queries/dashboards do their own research and share it in our new
charts and statistics section. We also added AI analytics to every dashboard so AI explains 
what's in there, figuring out trends and insights.

## Key Features:

* Charts And Statistics
* Share and Edit in Data Warehouse
* Do your own research using guru scan data and share dashboards in catalog
* AI Analytics for Dashboards with insights and trends
* Analytics For Addresses as separate tab
